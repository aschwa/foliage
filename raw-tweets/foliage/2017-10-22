Spent the weekend in Vermont and it's been so lovely and relaxing! So much quiet. Such nature. Much foliage.          https://t.co/ojjmLOGLCt
Visiting in the great state of Maine. My crazy wife water skiing on October 22. Foliage off the chart!

One of my favorite fall things to do with my favorite person          #SoPretty #FallFoliage #Mama  https://t.co/aV7kMaL8TJ
I only came to see the foliage in western mass
